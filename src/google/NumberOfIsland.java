/*
 * leetcode: 200 Number of islands
 * Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
 * You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
 *solution:
 * use dfs
 *1. to iterate each pixel and do dfs to each pixel which value is '1', when dfs to each pixel make that to '*'
 * 2. when meet the bound or < 0 or grid[][] != '1' return
 *
